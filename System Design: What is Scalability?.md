# Scalability
As a system grows, the performance starts to degrade unless we adapt it to deal with that growth.

Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of load by adding resources to the system.

> **A system that can continuously evolve to support a growing amount of work is scalable.**

# How can a System Grow?
A system can grow in several dimensions.
1. Growth in User Base
2. Growth in Features
3. Growth in Data
4. Growth in Complexity
5. Growth in Geographic Reach

# How to Scale a System
1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
2. Horizonta Scaling
3. Load Balancing
4. Caching
5. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
6. Partitioning
7. Asynchrounous Communication
8. Microservies Architecture
9. Auto Scaling
10. Multi-region Deployment
